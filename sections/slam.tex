\begin{frame}{Simultaneous Localization And Mapping}
  The \textbg{SLAM} problem is a \textbg{chicken-and-egg} problem: a robot must \textbg{localize itself} within an environment, while \textbg{mapping} it.\\
  \bigskip
  The ultimate goal of SLAM is to enable the robot to \textbg{navigate} within the environment, while \textbg{updating} the map as it moves.\\
  \bigskip
  The robot must be able to \textbg{efficiently} and \textbg{accurately} build a map of the environment, while \textbg{localizing itself} within it, with respect to either the origin of the map or the starting point of the robot itself (\emph{i.e.}, with either some or none \textbg{prior notion of the environment}).\\
  \bigskip
  To solve this problem, \textbg{sensor fusion} techniques are often employed, mixing data coming from \textbg{heterogeneous sensors} and accounting for \textbg{sensor faults}.
